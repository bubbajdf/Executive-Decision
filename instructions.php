<h2>SETUP</h2>
<div>
Players decide how many months will consitute a game.  Generally a game consists
of 12 months, however, beginners may prefer a shorter game until they become
familar with the play.
<br><br>
Each player receives a Tally sheet and the following amount of money:
<ul>
<li>2 players: $900</li>
<li>3 players: $600</li>
<li>4 players: $450</li>
<li>5 players: $350</li>
<li>6 players: $300</li>
</ul>
One player is chosen to be the Banker throughout the game.  That player handles
the Raw Material Certificates and money and posts the current Market Prices on the
Price Level Board.
</div>
<h2>PLAY</h2>
<div>
Each month of play consists of:
<ol>
<li>Purchasing Raw Materials, which are used to</li>
<li>Manufactoring the products of your choice and</li>
<li>Selling the Finished Goods in an attempt to make the greatest profit for your corporation.</li>
</ol>
<b>MONTH 1 (January) consists of the following, in order:</b><br><br>
<div class="accordion">
<h3>1. PURCHASING RAW MATERIAL CERTIFICATES.</h3>
<div>
After consulting the Price Level Board
(<i>Opening Price</i> column and <i>Market Calculator</i>), each player enters his January Order
for Raw Materials in the Big columns on the Tally Sheet - secretly recording
how many units of each grade he wishes to purchase and the <i>price per unit</i> he is
willing to pay.

Players orders may include bids for any or all of the three different grades of
Materials, but the total units of <i>all grades</i> ordered by one player <i>may not
exceed</i> the following amounts:
<br><br>
<table>
  <th>Number of Players</th>
  <th>Total Per Players</th>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>18 units*</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>12 units</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>9 units</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>7 units</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>6 units</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<span class="smalllabel">* When two play, no player may order more then 12 units of one grade of Material.</span>
<br><br>
When all bids have been recorded, each player, <i>in turn</i>, announces how many units
of X-FINE Material he has ordered.  Broker totals annouced units and consults
Market Calculator (Raw Materials Section) for price change.  Amount shown on
Calculator is added to or subtracted from Opening Price and resulting Market
Price for X-FINE is posted in January column of Price Level Board.  Market
Prices for FINE and STANDARD Materials are then determined in the same manner.
<br><br>
<i>Example: In January, orders of X-FINE total 12 units.  Market Calculator shows
+2 which is added to Opening Price of $40.  January Market Price of X-FINE is $42.
Players also ordered 5 units of FINE and 0 units of STANDARD.  Calculator shows
-5 for FINE and -10 for STANDARD.  January prices for these Materials are $25
and $10 respectively.</i>
<br><br>
Raw Material prices never drop below $1 per unit.  If Market Calculator indicates
that a particular Raw Material will drop to $0 or below, the Market Price of that
Material is <i>stabilized at $1</i> until demand forces the price up again.
<br><br>
After the current Market Prices have been posted, each player determines which
Raw Materials he has been successful in purchasing according to the following chart:
<br><table>
 <th>PLAYER's BID</th>
 <th>PLAYER's PURCHASE</th>
 <tr>
   <td>Equal to or higher than Market Price</td>
   <td>All Units at Bid Price</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Lower than Market Price</td>
   <td>No Units</td>
 </tr>
</table>
After adjusting his Tally Sheet by <i>crossing out any unsuccessful bids</i>, each player
totals his purchases, pays the Broker and receives one Raw Material Certificate
for each unit purchased.  These Certificates are placed face up in front of player so
all other players may see them.
<br><br>
If a player does not have sufficient funds to pay the Broker for the <i>total amount</i>
of his purchase, he is prohibited from buying <i>any</i> Raw Materials in that month.
<br><br>

<tr>

 <tr>
   <td>Raw Materials</td>
   <td>Units Bid</td>
   <td>Bid Price</td>
   <td>Amount Paid</td>

<i>Example: In a three-player game, player entered his January order as shown above.
Total Units of X-FINE ordered by all players was 11, raising Market Price to $41.
Total Units of FINE ordered was 15, bringing Market Price to $35.  Orders for
STANDARD totaled 7, dropping Market Price to $17. Player adjusted his Tally and
totaled his purchases as shown below.</i><br>

<h3>2. MANUFACTORING.</h3>
<div>
After consulting the Productions Chart on the Price 
Level Board, each player secretly decides on the amounts and kinds of Finished
Goods he <i>intends to manufacture</i> from the Raw Materials he has on hand.
<br><br>
Three units of Raw Materials are required to manufacture one unit of Finished
Goods as shown on Production Chart.  If a player is unable to supply the Raw
Materials specified on the Chart, he may still manufacture his Goods by
<i>substituting</i> an equal number of units of another Raw Material.  He
may either substitute X-FINE for FINE or FINE for STANDARD; these are the
only substitutions permitted.
<br><br>
<i>Example: Player wishes to manufacture a unit of "C".  Since he has only 1
unit of STANDARD he substitutes 1 unit of FINE.  Thus, his "C" will consist
of 2 FINE + 1 STANDARD.</i>
<br><br>
</div>
<h3>3. SELLING THE FINISHED GOODS</h3>
<div>
After consulting the Price Level Board
(<i>Opening Price</i> column and <i>Market Calculator</i>), each player enters
his January offering of Finished Goods in the <i>Bid</i> columns of his Tally
sheet - secretly recording <i>how many units</i> of each of the Finished Goods
he wishes to sell and the <i>price per unit</i> he is willing to accept.  He
may offer as many units of Finished Goods as he is able to manufacture.
<br><br>
After all players have entered their bids, Market Prices for the Finished Goods 
are determined in the same manner as for <i>Purchasing Raw Material Certificates</i>
except that Finished Goods section of Market Calculator is used.
<br><br>
<i>Example: In January, offerings of "A" total 7 units.  Market Calculator shows -3;
since Opening Price of "A" is $140, January Market Price is $137.  No units of "B"
were offered; Calculator shows +11 which is added to Opening Price of $115 for 
January Market Price of $126.  Offerings of "C" totaled 5 units. Since Calculator
shows +1 and Opening Price of "C" is $90, January Market Price is $91.</i>
<br><br>
After Market Prices have been posted, each player determines <i>which</i> Finished
Goods he has succeeded in selling according to the following chart:
<br><br>
<table>
 <th>PLAYER'S BID</th>
 <th>GOODS SOLD</th>
 <tr>
  <td>Equal to or lower than Market Price</td>
  <td>All Units at Bid Price</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Higher than Market Price</td>
  <td>No Units</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<br><br>
After adjusting their Tally sheets by <i>crossing out any overestimated bids</i>,
players total their sales.  The Broker pays each player for units sold and collects
the Raw Materials Certificates used in manufactoring the sold Goods.
<br><br>
If a player has made an error and cannot deliver the correct Raw Materials Certificates
for all Finished Goods he has sold, he is prohibited from selling <i>any</i>
Finished Goods in that month.

 <tr>
   <td>STD.</td>
   <td>3</td>
   <td>15</td>
   <td>45</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<br><br>
<i>Example: In three-player game, player entered January offering as shown above.
Total units of "A" offered for sale was 4, raising Market Price to $143.  Total
units of "B" was 1, bring Market Price to $124.  Offerings of "C" totaled 6,
dropping Market Price to $89.  Player adjusted his Tally and totaled sales 
as shown at right.</i>
<br><br>
<b>ALL OTHER MONTHS</b>.  Each month players purchase Raw Material Certificates,
manufacture and sell the Finished Goods in the same manner as for January.  When
determining current Market Prices, amounts shown on Market Calculator are added
to or subtracted from previous month's Market Price.

<h2>ENDING THE GAME</h2>
